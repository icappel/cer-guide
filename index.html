            <h2>What is this guide?</h2>
            <p>
                This guide aims to give Canadians a short but thorough introduction to
                the Canada Energy Regulator (CER).
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked there for almost a year starting in 2020, and I had to learn
                what it is and how its participation processes work. I figure some
                people might be able to benefit from my knowledge if I share it. This
                guide is entirely unofficial and is not endorsed or verified by
                anyone. It’s not legal advice and may contain errors. It reflects my
                understanding, but I might be wrong about some things. Some parts of
                this guide might not technically be completely correct, but I think
                are good enough to get a general understanding. This guide focuses on
                hearings, since even though the CER does more than that, hearings are
                the most likely reason a citizen would ever end up interacting with
                the CER.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>What is the the CER?</h2>
            <p>
                The CER is the a Government of Canada organization in charge of
                regulating energy projects that extend beyond a single province or
                territory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Energy projects include things like oil pipelines, natural gas
                pipelines, and electrical power lines. (I’ll mostly talk about
                pipelines since that’s what most of the energy projects are and what
                most people care about when they want to learn about the CER. Whenever
                I mention a pipeline, you can generally substitute it with something
                else like electrical power lines and it will still make sense.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Regulation includes things like choosing to give or not to give a
                company permission to carry out a project, making sure that companies
                that are allowed to build projects follow all the rules when building
                and operating their pipeline, and some other things as well. The CER
                performs inspections of and hears complaints about the construction
                and operation of the pipelines they regulate.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if a company wanted to build an oil pipeline from
                somewhere in Alberta to somewhere in Saskatchewan, they’d have to get
                permission from the CER. On the other hand, if a company wanted to
                build a natural gas pipeline from one side of Alberta to the other
                side of Alberta, it wouldn’t be the CER’s business since the pipeline
                is staying within Alberta (it would be under the Alberta Energy
                Regulator’s jurisdiction).
            </p>
            <p>
                The CER also performs some other functions like collecting, analyzing,
                and publishing data about how much energy is being produced and
                consumed in Canada.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Brief notes from the CER’s history</h2>
            <p>
                The CER is a relatively new organization. Its main role was previously
                carried out by the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Energy_Board">National Energy Board (NEB)</a>, which
                became the CER in 2019. The government got rid of the NEB
                after some very controversial hearings where it became clear that the
                NEB was not doing the best job at representing the interests of all
                Canadians. The organization was rebranded, senior
                leadership was replaced, the structure was changed somewhat, and the
                organization’s responsibilities were changed somewhat as well.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Hearings and participation</h2>
            <p>
                The most likely way that a citizen would interact with the CER is
                through a hearing. When a company wants to build something like a
                pipeline, a hearing may be held.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find CER hearings easiest to understand by comparing them to a
                court. The company (called the proponent) is on trial. People can
                bring up reasons why they shouldn’t be allowed to build their project,
                or propose possible risks that the company should have to mitigate.
                Since it’s the proponent that’s “on trial,” they are given some rights
                such as being the last to deliver closing arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The judge/jury is a panel of CER Commissioners who decide whether or
                not the project should go through. Usually, projects end up being
                allowed to be built, but with conditions that the company has to
                follow. The Commissioners are tasked with making a decision in the
                Canadian public interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participating as someone other than the proponent can come in two
                forms: you can be an intervenor or a commenter. There are also ways
                you can keep up to date as a member of the general public.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>General public</h2>
            <p>
                All of the documents submitted throughout the hearing process (with a
                couple exceptions) form a public record. Anyone can view the documents
                in the CER’s online document repository,
                <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS">REGDOCS</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone is also allowed to
                <a
                    href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/applications-hearings/participate-hearing/hearing-process/hearings-information-sessions-conferences.html">watch
                    the hearing proceedings online</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Commenters</h2>
            <p>
                In terms of actually participating in a hearing, being a commenter is
                the easiest option. You simply put your input (opinions and any
                relevant information you might have) into a letter and submit it. This
                letter of comment will be considered by the Commission. Keep in mind
                that your letter of comment will become part of the
                <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS">public hearing record, which is available online</a>.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Intervenors</h2>
            <p>
                Continuing with the courtroom analogy from before, intervenors are
                like lawyers. They can present evidence, ask other participants
                questions, and provide final arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be an intervenor, you have to apply, stating how you’re affected by
                the proposed project (e.g. it is going through your land) and/or any
                relevant information or expertise you might have (e.g. you’re a
                biologist with thoughts on how the project will affect the local
                ecosystem). Even if you aren’t accepted as an intervenor, you’ll still
                be allowed to participate as a commenter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Intervenors are also sometimes able to apply for
                <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/applications-hearings/participate-hearing/participant-funding/">participant
                    funding</a>. Participant funding lets people get reimbursed for some expenses
                that can go into participating, such as legal fees, consultant fees,
                and some travel expenses. The amounts vary, but as of this writing the
                maximums can be up $12,000 for individuals and $80,000 for groups.
                Indigenous governments are especially encouraged to apply for
                participant funding. Note that to be eligible for participant funding,
                the project must have a fairly immediate impact on you, such as going
                through your land.

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>
                In my very limited experience at the CER, I have noticed some
                factors that may help you participate more successfully. Here
                they are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Many CER hearings have a
                    <a
                        href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/applications-hearings/participate-hearing/hearing-process/process-advisor-support-hearing-participants.html">process
                        advising team</a>. These people can answer your
                    questions and help you to participate. They’re not
                    allowed to give you advice on what to submit, but can
                    help you navigate the process of getting your voice heard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The CER doesn’t like form letters. If you just put your name on a letter written by someone else,
                    this doesn’t add much weight. Your opinion will be taken more seriously if you write your own letter
                    of comment, even if it is short. To put it another way, 100 long, identical letters submitted by
                    different people are not as impactful as 100 short unique letters, all written and submitted by
                    different people.</li>
                <li>Indigenous governments are guaranteed intervenor status if they seek it. If you are an Indigenous
                    person, mentioning this may also increase the weight given to your contributions. The CER is
                    committed to advancing Reconciliation.</li>
                <li>While any documents submitted as part of a hearing become part of the public record by default, it
                    is possible to request the ability to make <a
                        href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/applications-hearings/submit-applications-documents/sensitive-documents.html">confidential
                        submissions</a> in certain circumstances, including for sharing <a
                        href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/applications-hearings/submit-applications-documents/confidential-indigenous-knowledge.html">confidential
                        Indigenous knowledge</a> e.g. the location of spiritual sites. Note that if specific
                    confidential information leads to a decision that affects somebody (such as the proponent company),
                    that party has a legal right to know the information that lead to the decision, even if the
                    information is not made publicly available.</li>
                <li>The CER’s official record is still technically paper. All of the digital documents are just for
                    convenience. For some document submissions, you have to mail a physical copy of your document in
                    order for it to be an official part of the record. The online forms will tell you when this is the
                    case, so make sure you follow those instructions.</li>
                <li>The hearing order for a given hearing has lots of useful information about participating and
                    addresses common points of confusion.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Other hearing types</h2>
            <p>
                So far, I’ve talked about the hearings used to determine whether or not a project is allowed to be
                built. There are also hearings that can occur after this initial hearing.
            </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Detailed route hearings</h3>
                <p>
                    After a large pipeline has been approved for construction, another hearing may be held to determine
                    the
                    specific, detailed route the pipeline will follow. If you’re a landowner and the proposed route
                    passes
                    through your land, this type of hearing is where you can try to argue that the pipeline should take
                    a
                    different route instead. <a

            <section>
                <h3>Tolls and tariffs hearings</h3>
                <p>
                    This type of hearing is not usually relevant to individual citizens. Once a pipeline has been built,
                    the
                    company that built the pipeline can allow other companies to pay them to be able to ship fuel
                    through
                    the pipeline. These companies that ship fuel through a pipeline are called “shippers.” Shippers can
                    complain to the CER that the company that owns the pipeline is charging unfair prices, in which case
                    a
                    tolls or tariffs hearing may be held. <a

        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Complaints and ADR</h2>
            <p>
                If you have a complaint against a company the CER regulates, <a
                    href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/consultation-engagement/land-matters-guide/complaint-resolution.html">you
                    can tell the CER about this</a>. For example, a company might be making excess construction noise at
                unreasonable hours of the night, or construction may have damaged your crops, or a company might be
                breaking some rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you complain to the CER, there are two ways things can go: if you and the company both agree to it,
                you could do <a
                    href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/consultation-engagement/alternative-dispute-resolution/">alternative
                    dispute resolution (ADR)</a>. This is where you, the company, and the CER sit down together to try
                and come to a compromise, much like mediation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you and the company don’t both agree to ADR or can’t reach an agreement through ADR, there will be a
                formal process where the Commission will make a decision about what will happen.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Help you can get</h2>
            <p>
                If you need help participating in a CER proceeding, you have a number of options available.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, you can contact the CER. They can explain how the process works and help you navigate it. For
                larger hearings, they usually have a process advisory team as mentioned above. Even if not, you can call
                them and they can help you out. The only caveat is that while the CER can help you participate, they
                aren’t allowed to give advice. For example, they can tell you how to submit a letter of comment or file
                evidence, but to maintain fairness they can’t tell you what to include in your letter or which evidence
                to file.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like in-depth help and/or advice when participating, there are people you can hire for
                this. You can hire a lawyer, and there are also consultants who specialize in navigating regulatory
                processes, particularly for Indigenous governments. Hiring people obviously costs money, so you may may
                want to check whether or not your costs would be eligible to be reimbursed by participant funding.
                Remember that participant funding is only available to intervenors. Unfortunately, I don’t know enough
                to be able to recommend anybody as a good hired representative.
